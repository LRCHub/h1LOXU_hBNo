Aye what's poppin' b
I see you watching me
Whole clip strapped, but I still got that Glock on me
Left me (?) just to rock on the beat
Bitch I've been up like a week
Might take a nap and I'll still catch a play In my sleep
Pull up in a SRT
Leaving my hood night catch a jet
Aye what's poppin' b
I see you watching me

I got the recipe
My diamonds water like jetski
She tryn' suck me and sex me
Leave em on read when she text me
I'm a real zone 6 young nigga better know I got me a hoe on (?)
Hellcat geeked up special
Nobody can catch me
Ain't get to the money? just shut up
Cut that shit better
Only go to the bag when I make a deposite
They told me "stay down and get it" I got it
Backwood filled with biscaitie
As soon as you try me you dying
Top flow having that Nicki Minaj
Bitch ate my dick like a molly
Shooters they standing right behind me
Dont go back before they working on no diamonds

Aye what's poppin' b

Came a long way from that EBT
Bitch all over my dick like Tmz
Still dont want fire
Niggas know where I be
Still in my bag aye let me call YV
Beat that truck down
Lay lie leh
I got em racks
Alexander McQueen on my feet
None of my cards need a god damn key
If I didn't get a set where would I be
I dont know probably on the front street
Or probably be serving your auntie
Just might catch me a jet out the country
Neck full of carats and shit like a bunny
Nigga just started the shit I've been down stay down
Look at the star I'm becoming
You ain't going harder than hard then you ain't worth nothing
