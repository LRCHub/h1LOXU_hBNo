Back with the remix
These boys all my sons
like Phoenix
My city and state
never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron
I'm a young boy genius
On the futon
I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done
I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh like Gilbert Arenas
Shoot my shot
I'm still with the demons ooh
I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York
that means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home though
they treat me like
Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell
bought her a churro
Took her home
gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in
now I got a one-year-old
Zeros on zeros on zeros
That's what my bank account
balance say
I got a check
from the shoe company
Now I do anything
that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket
out of state
I got me a shorty
from 'round the way
Said “I'm in town today"
She said she comin' over
and she down to stay
I got a hit
she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me
I know what she 'bout to say
What's poppin'
Brand new whip just hopped in
I got options
I could pass that bitch
like Stockton
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday
locked in
My body got rid of them toxins
SportsCenter top ten
Call up my bitch
tell her “Bring me that noggin"
Brain real good
she a scholar
I like the thing
with low mileage
good brain with no college
Call me DaBaby no toddler
I'm real creative and stylish
F&N in my denim
I send a hit
make him spin 'em
And I just flew back from L.A.
on the jet yesterday
I go back and forth
like I play tennis
I fuck with your ho
yeah I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard
the number one song in UK
And I done got so fuckin' rich
all these hoes on my dick
I still don't give a fuck
what you say
She eat it like a Pac-Man nigga
Whoop a nigga
like I'm Batman nigga
I just pulled up
in the Batmobile
The reason I ain't fuckin'
with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas
and they raps ain't real
Believe me
you wanna keep your life
then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds
need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down
they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown
like I'm in Cleveland
My bitch is Mello Yello
like a soda
These niggas tattletalers
I'm a soldier
Ayy somebody tell them niggas
that it's over
You know it's Baby nigga
What's poppin'
Brand new whip just hopped in
I got options
I could pass that bitch
like Stockton
Hop out that Scat
and I caught her
I'm out here
with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy
I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it
I will not go kiss it
Or put my lips on it
like somebody water
The diamond the glacier
the card in the wallet
She pulled up to fuck me
but nobody caught her
She told me that
she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her
she told me “It's nobody harder
And I'm with the G-ski
I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin'
no pussy you sellin'
on Peachtree
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches
“Email it to reach me"
All in my DM
I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski
we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed
and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski
nigga you knows me
You ain't believe it
you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler
In case you was coolin'
and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga
came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again
I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep
that she cough up her lung again
Five-star bitches
they on the run again
run again
Runnin' in diamonds
they illuminatin' in a way
that I come again
I just put so many pennies
on a watch
That I don't ever got
to stunt again
nigga lil' Tory
What's poppin'
Brand new whip just hopped in
I got options
I could pass that bitch
like Stockton
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday
locked in
My body got rid of them toxins
SportsCenter top ten
Uh what's brackin'
Brand new whip new mansion
Brand new tips new dancers
Same old dick new Magnums
Same old shit new maggots
Same old throne new dragons
Same old strong new ashes

Gonna drown in this milk

Brand new phone

Put a bad bitch

Dark-haired bitches like Shego

Although I'm Don Corleone
